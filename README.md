### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs to do, simply because it was the introduction to the coding process.

* Lab 5 was also one of my favorite labs to work on. This lab incorporated the idea of Mad Libs and how a user can select different types of combinations for their sandwich :).

* Lab 12 was a great project to work on, because we utilized a new type of file called “Magick Image”. This file creates images and different types of image file format.
